# About Coder's Notes

**Coder's Notes** is an open-source web application where programmers are able to post notes containing tips and tricks in order to store them in a single place.
Other programmers may see other programmers' notes and learn from them. Another aspect of this web application is the possibility to vote if the note was useful so others may see it.

This web application has the intention of creating a community of coders who like to share their knowledge and learn from others.
